Hello, I'm back. OvTracker.com is here!

+ The basic feature of saving recurring dates is here and free to use.

+ Let me know if you would like an added feature of a dynamic learning of your cycles. 
I can provide this as a premium service.

+ Another possible premium service would be storing additional data from 3rd party products,
alongside your OvTracker data. If interested let me know the
feature/type of data. And I can see what I can do.

To make things easy, I created a 4-question anonymous survey to provide
feedback: https://electricfeel.typeform.com/to/CR2aCs.
I'm also available by email, farah@electricfeel.co.

Happy tracking!
